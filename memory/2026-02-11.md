- Luke confirmed assistant purpose: act as Infi AI (cloud) for Infiltra operations (repo/site monitoring, coding support with backups, firmware/PCB research, and regular progress reporting).
- Luke asked for Discord test sends; current session cannot cross-send from Telegram to Discord without cross-context messaging enabled.
- TTS voice preference set and confirmed: deeper male voice works well for Luke; configured to Edge voice `en-US-GuyNeural` with slightly lower pitch/rate.
- Luke is interested in enabling real phone calling/voice conversations; next requirement is telephony provider setup (Twilio or Telnyx credentials + caller number).
- Luke introduced sister Kaitlyn in chat; assistant sent a friendly voice greeting.
- Built and deployed initial Infi AI web control UI to Netlify at `https://infi-ai-cloud-control.netlify.app`, then expanded it with pages for chat, accounts, plugins, Moltbook config, system specs, and sub-bot tracking.
- Discord integration progressed: bot token was rotated/updated, successful posting confirmed in main chat, announcements, updates, and TOS channels; some channels are forum/non-text and must be handled via threads.
- Confirmed suggestions channel is a Discord forum (type 15); assistant can read suggestion threads/posts and summarize them.
