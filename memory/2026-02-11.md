- Luke confirmed assistant purpose: act as Infi AI (cloud) for Infiltra operations (repo/site monitoring, coding support with backups, firmware/PCB research, and regular progress reporting).
- Luke asked for Discord test sends; current session cannot cross-send from Telegram to Discord without cross-context messaging enabled.
- TTS voice preference set and confirmed: deeper male voice works well for Luke; configured to Edge voice `en-US-GuyNeural` with slightly lower pitch/rate.
- Luke is interested in enabling real phone calling/voice conversations; next requirement is telephony provider setup (Twilio or Telnyx credentials + caller number).
- Luke introduced sister Kaitlyn in chat; assistant sent a friendly voice greeting.
