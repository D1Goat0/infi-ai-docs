- Luke confirmed assistant purpose: act as Infi AI (cloud) for Infiltra operations (repo/site monitoring, coding support with backups, firmware/PCB research, and regular progress reporting).
- Luke asked for Discord test sends; current session cannot cross-send from Telegram to Discord without cross-context messaging enabled.
- TTS voice preference set and confirmed: deeper male voice works well for Luke; configured to Edge voice `en-US-GuyNeural` with slightly lower pitch/rate.
- Luke is interested in enabling real phone calling/voice conversations; next requirement is telephony provider setup (Twilio or Telnyx credentials + caller number).
- Luke introduced sister Kaitlyn in chat; assistant sent a friendly voice greeting.
- Built and deployed initial Infi AI web control UI to Netlify at `https://infi-ai-cloud-control.netlify.app`, then expanded it with pages for chat, accounts, plugins, Moltbook config, system specs, and sub-bot tracking.
- Discord integration progressed: bot token was rotated/updated, successful posting confirmed in main chat, announcements, updates, and TOS channels; some channels are forum/non-text and must be handled via threads.
- Confirmed suggestions channel is a Discord forum (type 15); assistant can read suggestion threads/posts and summarize them.
- Added INFI AI architecture spec file: `INFI_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` with cloud/embedded design, 3-tier embedded targets, schemas, and phase plan.
- Gateway workflows/jobs configured for Luke: hourly ops updates (8 AM–10 PM), 2-hour Discord suggestions digest, daily social analytics (8 PM), nightly 10 PM deep-work kickoff, and existing 3:30 PM daily report.
- Reliability requirement captured from Luke: send start/milestone/completion updates in Telegram first (dashboard secondary), especially for timed tasks.
- Installed Homebrew successfully on host (linuxbrew) and initialized shellenv in `.bashrc`.
- Luke requested all-night INFI AI docs run; overnight report delivered at `docs/INFI-AI-all-night-run-2026-02-11.md` with board tiering, secure OTA strategy, and monetization tracks.
- Luke installed additional OpenClaw skills; expanded skill set now includes key ops/coding integrations (e.g., github, discord, voice-call, notion/obsidian/trello, whisper/TTS-related tools).
- Overnight execution block completed for INFI AI planning: created `INFI_AI_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`, `INFI_AI_DEVICE_TIER_MATRIX.md`, `INFI_AI_INTEGRATION_NOTES.md`, and `INFI_AI_REVENUE_PATHS.md`. Key calls: ESP32-S3-first v1 support (M5StickC Plus 2, Cardputer, LilyGO T-Embed), STM32 as beta/strategic expansion, modular firmware integration via intent/knowledge/router modules, and subscription-led monetization (Pro/Team/OEM) tied to tier capabilities and recommended board support.
