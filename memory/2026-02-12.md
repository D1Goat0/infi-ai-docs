## INFI AI all-night deep research milestone
- Delivered full documentation expansion for Luke with a single-source execution manual and three supporting deep-dive specs.
- Added hardware-focused analysis for ESP32 + STM32 families with tier-fit guidance and board-level recommendation tiers (recommended/beta/not recommended).
- Added concrete dataset build spec with schemas, ingestion flow, validation gates, dedupe policy, packaging contract, and CI jobs.
- Added startup operating rhythm doc with daily/weekly cadence, ownership matrix, KPI and risk review rituals, release rhythm, and explicit tomorrow-morning actions.
- Updated existing INFI docs to cross-link to new canonical docs for consistency.

## Operational setup + reliability notes
- Luke requires timed-task reliability with Telegram-first updates (start/milestone/completion in chat, dashboard secondary).
- Added/confirmed Gateway cron workflows: hourly ops updates, Discord suggestions digest cadence, daily social analytics, nightly deep-work kickoff, and weekday 3:30 PM report.
- Installed Homebrew on host (linuxbrew) and initialized shell environment for future plugin/tool dependencies.
- Discord integration is active with mixed channel types; forum channels (e.g., suggestions/projects/files) require thread-based reading/triage rather than plain text posting.
