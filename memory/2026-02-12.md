## INFI AI all-night deep research milestone
- Delivered full documentation expansion for Luke with a single-source execution manual and three supporting deep-dive specs.
- Added hardware-focused analysis for ESP32 + STM32 families with tier-fit guidance and board-level recommendation tiers (recommended/beta/not recommended).
- Added concrete dataset build spec with schemas, ingestion flow, validation gates, dedupe policy, packaging contract, and CI jobs.
- Added startup operating rhythm doc with daily/weekly cadence, ownership matrix, KPI and risk review rituals, release rhythm, and explicit tomorrow-morning actions.
- Updated existing INFI docs to cross-link to new canonical docs for consistency.

## Operational setup + reliability notes
- Luke requires timed-task reliability with Telegram-first updates (start/milestone/completion in chat, dashboard secondary).
- Added/confirmed Gateway cron workflows: hourly ops updates, Discord suggestions digest cadence, daily social analytics, nightly deep-work kickoff, and weekday 3:30 PM report.
- Installed Homebrew on host (linuxbrew) and initialized shell environment for future plugin/tool dependencies.
- Discord integration is active with mixed channel types; forum channels (e.g., suggestions/projects/files) require thread-based reading/triage rather than plain text posting.
- Luke clarified expectation for “all-night/hours-long” runs: must continue for fixed long durations with checkpoints, not stop early on quality-complete.
- Tomorrow execution priorities from Luke: continuous school-day operation, hourly Discord + TikTok analytics reporting, morning briefing, today worklist, frequent completion updates, Fused Up website UX/function upgrades + Epic API/tournament integration (repo link pending), INFI AI cloud-base build, firmware RF expansion work, and client prospecting alerts.
- Fused Up repo confirmed: https://github.com/ghostfirmwareofficial-tech/fused-spark-hub (local clone: `repos/fused-spark-hub`). Netlify deploy fix prepared + committed locally: added `netlify.toml` (build command + publish=dist + Node 20) and SPA redirects (`public/_redirects`), plus `.gitignore` to ignore `.env`. Commit: `717c16f` (pending Luke confirmation to push).
- INFI AI docs were pushed to GitHub repo: https://github.com/D1Goat0/infi-ai-docs.
- Luke requested school-day sub-jobs with ~20-minute interval pulses (min 10m if needed); added cron: “Luke School Interval Pulse (every 20 min)” (8am–3:59pm weekdays).
- Cron schedule was expanded/updated accordingly: hourly ops updates, hourly Discord digest, hourly TikTok/social analytics, weekday 7:00 AM morning briefing, weekday 7:10 AM today plan, every-2-hours progress reminders, and weekday 7:20 AM long school-day execution block (model override: opus).
